# Able

"Able" is a challenging, physics-based puzzle game where your task is to climb to the top using only the strength of your arms.

Use Q, W, O, and P to control the arms (Q/P to grab/ungrab; W/O to pull yourself up).

Starter tip: Press Q and P together to grab on to both sides of the shaft, then press and hold W and O together to hoist yourself up. Try building up some momentum!

Inspired by games such as [QWOP](http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html), [Getting over it](https://store.steampowered.com/app/240720/Getting_Over_It_with_Bennett_Foddy/), and [GIRP](http://www.foddy.net/GIRP.html).

Please note that being a #LudwigJam game, the game is fairly short. My PB is currently 5 minutes and 58 seconds, you can see the video here: <https://youtu.be/0iIvGx8S0EE>. A new player could get stuck for a few hours, though!
